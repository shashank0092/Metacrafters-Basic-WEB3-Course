1)Missing Constructor Visibility: Add the constructor keyword and set the visibility to public.

2)Uninitialized Struct Pointer: Initialize the Storage struct when declaring it.

3)Insecure Access Control: Add appropriate access control mechanisms, such as the onlyOwner modifier to restrict access to the store() function only to the contract owner.

4)Unused Function: Remove the getOwner() function from the contract.

5)Outdated Solidity Version: Update the Solidity version to the latest stable version, which is currently 0.8.4.
